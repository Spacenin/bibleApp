# bibleApp
This is an application that uses a publicly available API, [API.Bible](https://scripture.api.bible/), to send daily verses to myself via [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)'s messaging API.
I have all stored data within a secrets.json file stored locally on the server, which in this case is my Raspberry Pi.
